# PopQuiz

A collaborative voting platform for teams to discover and rank their favorite movies together.

## What is PopQuiz?

PopQuiz turns movie discussions into a fun, interactive experience. Team members swipe through movies with a Tinder-style interface, voting Yes, No, or Meh on each title. The app then aggregates these votes to reveal team rankings, identify taste compatibility between members, and surface movies that spark debate.

## Key Features

## Who It's For

PopQuiz is designed for friend groups, work teams, film clubs, or any group that loves discussing movies and wants to discover their collective taste. Whether you're planning movie night or just curious about your team's cinematic preferences, PopQuiz makes it easy and fun to track everyone's opinions.
